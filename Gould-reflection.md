# Dylan Gould Reflects on GPS 1.1

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * Before the session, I honestly thought I was understanding Git pretty well. I am very familiar with the general concept of version control, having worked in game development for over a decade.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * How branches on the GitHub repo work, and how they differ from local branches
  * How different users see each others' `commit`s & `push`es on GitHub
  * How to `clone` a repo - _I'd only done it once before, so I forgot_
  * How to `pull` from GitHub to local - _Same thing here_
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * What's a license and how do you add it?
  * What is `fetch` and how does it work?
  * What's the difference between the Markdown we've been doing and the GitHub flavor?
  * Why doesn't Git warn & stop you when you're about to create a nested repo? Given that it causes so many issues, doesn't that seem dumb?
* What still confuses you about Git?
  * I still don't know what `fetch` is for, or more specifically how to use it and when to use it - I understand that it's safer than `pull`, but I don't really know why, because I don't know what `pull` does wrong. During this session we eventually decided to skip it and move forward with what we'd used before, `clone` and `pull`, and that worked out just fine.
  * I'm also pretty unsure about why it's necessary to have `push` and `pull` as separate steps. It's not clear when anybody would want to `push` from their local up to GitHub and not immediately go to GitHub and `pull` what was just `push`ed, but if you'd never want to, then they should just be a single step, as far as I'm concerned.
  * Being familiar with Perforce and Subversion, I am often confused by the term `checkout` in Git.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * I enjoyed the experience and felt like I learned a lot. There was plenty of confusion, most of which turned into understanding eventually.
